        <p>
            Hello! My name is Dianna Higaki, and I am a junior at S.I. Newhouse School of Public Communications at Syracuse University. <br>I am an <strong>advertising major with a creative emphasis</strong> leaning towards the art director path. <br>I am passionate about art, design, and graphics and aspire to use this creativity in my future profession.
        </p>
        <p>
            As for skills, I am proficient in Adobe applications such as:
            <ul>

                <li>InDesign</li>
                <li>Illustrator</li>
                <li>Premiere Pro</li>
            </ul>I also have knowledge in:

                <li>Facebook Ads Manager</li>
                <li>SEO</li>

    <h2>Personal Information</h2>
    <p>
        Outside of work, I have a very long list of interests and hobbies.
    </p>
    <p>
        I enjoy art related tasks such as drawing, painting, and graphic design. <br>I have future aspirations of designing my own stickers, so I can start a side hustle or small business one day. <br> I also love binging detective shows on Netflix, like Criminal Minds, and learning about the human psyche.
    </p>
    <p>
        Soccer has been a part of my life since I was young, and this drew me to try out for and join the women's club soccer team here at Syracuse. <br>And as far a music goes, I listen to anything and everything from RnB to EDM to Korean Pop.
