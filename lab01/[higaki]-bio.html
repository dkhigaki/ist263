    A little bit about me~ Hello! My name is Dianna Higaki, and I am a junior at S.I. Newhouse School of Public Communications at Syracuse University. I am an advertising major with a creative emphasis leaning towards the art director path. I am passionate about art, design, and graphics and aspire to use this creativity in my future profession. As for skills, I am proficient in Adobe applications such as Photoshop, InDesign, Illustrator, and Premiere Pro. I also have knowledge in Facebook Ads Manager, SEO, and influencer outreach. Outside of work, I have a very long list of interests and hobbies. I enjoy art related tasks such as drawing, painting, and graphic design. I have future aspirations of designing my own stickers, so I can start a side hustle or small business one day. I also love binging detective shows on Netflix, like Criminal Minds, and learning about the human psyche. Soccer has been a part of my life since I was young, and this drew me to try out for and join the women’s club soccer team here at Syracuse. And as far a music goes, I listen to anything and everything from RnB to EDM to Korean Pop. Welcome to my website! :)
